ELDER| 1| The tale of this kingdom begins long ago, in the times of old.|2| Turia was once ruled by the Queen Araena.| A fair and just Queen, she ruled the kingdom with great wisdom, she was beloved by all. 
|The people of Turia obeyed her every command…such was their loyalty towards their Queen.| Yet Araena did not rule her kingdom with wisdom alone…|3|the loyalty of her people was granted by a much greater power…the gift of magic.
|With Araena’s magic, magnificent cities were formed…and the Spirit Talkers summoned forth the Sacred Spirits of the land.|  Ages past… the Kingdom Prospered.|4| However, for such power there is always a price to be paid…Araena’s obsession with magic would eventually consume her…
|The Queens trusted advisor Kai told her of an Ancient Temple in the darkest corner of the land.| In the depths of this Temple, she would find far greater power beyond imagining…
|Araena and her royal subjects travelled to the Ancient Temple in the far reaches of the kingdom.| Entering the temple, they descended into the depths. |5|In the darkness they discovered the source of magic…crystals of the void withholding endless magical power. 
|Araena stands before the crystals.|6| Araena recited the words of the ancient ritual,| drawing the Magical Energy from the Crystals.| The ritual was a success…Araena’s power grew.| Yet it was to be the beginning of the Kingdom’s Tragedy.
|The surge of magical energy caused a rupture in reality, opening a portal to the void.| From this dimension of nothingness, the spirits of shadow entered the kingdom…possessing the ill-fated citizens of Turia.
|7|Yet…the will of the Spirit Talkers still remains…we have hope, however faint.| Aro…will you fulfil your destiny?| Will you learn the ways of the Spirit Talker?| We shall see…|Level1|/
