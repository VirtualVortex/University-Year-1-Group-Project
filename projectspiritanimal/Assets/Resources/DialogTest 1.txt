CEP:| Elder! Elder!|@|
Hmm yes? I trust this is of importance Cep...|
CEP:|Elder! We need your help! The village...the village is in great danger Elder!|@|
Wha-what? Impossible. Impossible I say! Not a single soul has set foot in our village for years...|
CEP:| I speak the truth Elder! The Lost Spirits...the Lost Spirits have come for us! They are here!|@|
No....no...it cannot be. They dare not to venture past the Hollow Tree...this is unspeakable.|
CEP:| They've already taken the other villagers. I tried to stop them...but I feared for my own life.|@|
Such insolence...they dare to trespass?| Then it is as prophecy foretold. You must go Aro... summon the Spirit Beasts and close the portals.| Stop the Lost Spirits before it's too late!|/

Bjorn(Bear)| Who summons me? Who disturbs my slumber? It has been many years…this place…the sacred caves…Turia| A fading memory…but I still remember to this day…

Chestnut| The abundance of ore in these caves is simply staggering Hohohoh.| I can't wait to tell Cep all about this...oh yes, we'll make millions! We'll be rich, rich I say! Hohohoh!|
Oh....oh oh??| Now now now... w-who do we have here now?| Hmm yes yes? Who might you be?| Hohoh! Can't you s-see I'm rather busy here??|

Theo(Rabbit)| *Yawn* Who…what? Man…so…sleepy *yawn* where...where am I?| Oh...the Burrow's, Home sweet home. Ok ok no need for the usual formailities.| The names Theo, Spirit of Speed.| Take it you already met ol'Bjorn here huh?|

Bjorn:|Indeed...we have been acquainted...now I follow the Spirit Talker's command.| It's been some time Theo...|@|
Good to see you again big guy!| What's the deal here anyway?| I was quite enjoying my time in the Spiritworld it's quite the party heheheh!|

Bjorn:| Hmph....unlike yourself, I have been training my abilities in the halls of Valour for this very moment.|I knew this day would come.| This is not a time for frivolity or idleness.|I hate to disappoint you Theo, but there will be no feasting or dancing here!|@|
Aahhh Bjorn...no need to be an ol'grouch is there? Lighten up old man!| Things ain't so bad... it's just the end times that's all! Let's have a toast... to the good old days!|

Bjorn:| Bah! You are trying my patience little one...how many times must I tell you?| We have been summoned to send these accursed spirits back to the void whence they came, understand?|We swore a solemn oath as Guardians!| Bjorn:|I tire of this idle chatter...we have a kingdom to save!|@|

Syrup Rouge| Ahhh! Wha-what?| W..wh-who goes there?| Leave me be!| Have mercy aahh!| Hold on...wait.| Er..oh my...you aren't one of those things.| Oh thank heavens...I thought my days were numbered there. 
|Please...I don't want to turn into one of those things.| I...I can already feel the void's corruption taking hold of me... I must leave this place and find the Elder!|/

Quiyll(Bird)| Such insolence. Who dares to disturb my studies of the Arcane.|
Bjorn:| Quiyll...it's been a while.| *Sigh* You haven't changed I see...|@|
Hmph. And you’re still the same stubborn old brute by the looks of things.| You’d better have a very good reason to bother me Bjorn.| I have far more important matters to attend to.|
Bjorn:| There is no time to waste Quiyll!| It’s just as we feared.The Lost Spirits have already ventured past the Hollow Tree...we must close the portal!|@|
*Sigh* I tire of this foolishness. Very well. We shall head to the Temple then.| I will follow you Spirit Talker...|Destroy|/
